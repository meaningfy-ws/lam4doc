The Council reserves all its rights in law as regards any unauthorised publication.)\nSubject: Date of adoption of acts under the ordinary legislative procedure - application of Article 13 of the Regulation on Committee Procedure (1)\n\n1. The purpose of this opinion of the Legal Service is to clarify the determination of the date on which acts are adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\n2. This question has arisen in particular for acts which were adopted before the Committee Procedure Regulation entered into force on 1 March 2011 and were signed by the Presidents of the European Parliament and of the Council after that date. Insofar as those acts refer to the old Decision on Committee Procedure (2), which was repealed on 1 March 2011 by the Regulation on Committee Procedure, the question arises of the applicability of Article 13 of the Regulation on Committee Procedure.\n\n3. Under Article 294(4) TFEU, when the Council approves the position of the European Parliament at first reading \"the act concerned shall be adopted in the wording which corresponds to the position of the European Parliament\". The date of adoption of the act is therefore that on which the Council approved the European Parliament\u0027s position.\n\n4. At second reading, the act is deemed to be adopted when: (a) within three months following the transmission of the first-reading position of the Council\nto the European Parliament, the latter approves the Council\u2019s position or has not taken a decision (3); in that case, the date of adoption of the act should be considered to be that on which the European Parliament approved the Council\u0027s position or the date when the three-month period expired; or (b) within three months following receipt of the European Parliament\u0027s amendments, the Council approves all the European Parliament\u0027s amendments by a qualified majority (4 ); in that case, the date of adoption of the act should be considered to be that on which the Council approved the European Parliament\u0027s amendments.\n\n5. At third reading, the act is adopted when, within a period of \u2013 in principle \u2013 six weeks following the approval of a joint text by the Conciliation Committee, the European Parliament and the Council adopt the act in question in accordance with that text(5). In that case, the date of adoption of the act should be deemed to be the date when the act was adopted by the second of the two institutions.\n\n6. The signing of the act by the presidents of the two institutions, provided for in Article 297(1), is distinct from the adoption of the act and its value consists solely in authentication of the act (6). Therefore, even if the date of signing is included in the title of the act, as published in the Official Journal, as the date of the act, it is not the same as the date of the act\u0027s adoption.\n\n7. Furthermore, the Legal Service deems incorrect the practice of including the date of signing of an act in its title, in that it can lead to confusion as to the date of the act\u0027s birth in the legal system of the EU, despite the systematic inclusion in acts adopted by the ordinary legislative procedure of a footnote specifying the dates on which the European Parliament and the Council adopted their positions.\n\n8. In conclusion, the Legal Service considers that it follows from Article 294 TFEU that the date on which an act is adopted by the ordinary legislative procedure is the date of the decision of the arm of the legislature that acts later (see paragraphs 3 to 5 above) and not the date of the joint signing of the act by the presidents of the European Parliament and of the Council. Article 13 of the Regulation on Committee Procedure therefore applies to acts adopted before 1 March 2011 but signed after that date.\n\n(1) Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13).\n\n(2) Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23).\n\n(3) Article 294(7)(a) TFEU.\n\n(4) Article 294(8)(a) TFEU.\n\n(5) Article 294 (13) TFEU.\n\n(6) However, as the Court of Justice has already held, failure to sign an act is an infringement of an essential procedural requirement of the act, which may, even automatically, entail the annulment of the act concerned by the EU\u0027s courts (Judgment of 6 April 2000 in cases (C-287/95 and C-288/95, ECR 2000 p.

When the document deals with one special issue, indexing must then be done using the most specific descriptor fitting as properly as possible the topic covered by the document. If no existing heading specifically suits the document, it has to be filed under the closest more general entry.\nAs a consequence, the same document should never be indexed simultaneously using, within the same directory, a general heading and a more specific heading positioned hierarchically underneath it.\nFor example, the same document should bear one proper descriptor and not be labelled as such: 07.20.30.00 Transport policy / Inland transport / Market operation; 07.20.30.30 Transport policy / Inland transport / Market operation / Transport prices and terms \nWhen a document deals with multiple topics related to several sub-headings of the same chapter, instead of indexing under one general entry, multiple headings should be chosen provided they all are of the same level. However, it is better to minimize the number of descriptors used to prevent that acts are published in several places in the directory. For example, a text regarding both excise duties and individual tax exemptions should be analysed as such: 09.30.20. Taxation / Indirect taxation / Excise duties; 09.30.40. Taxation / Indirect taxation / Individual tax exemptions; and not 09.30. Taxation / Indirect taxation.\nThe classification of EUR-Lex documents with the Directory Codes will have to be performed in line with the ISO 5963 standard, completed with what the guidelines as stated in this document.\n******Classification principles: Classification consists of assigning documents to one or more categories based on their main topics. When classifying, it must be kept in mind that it is not the content of the document that is being described (indexation) but the main subject(s) that the document covers (classification). Basic principles of classification: (a) Follow the three stages of classification (Examination of the document - intellectual analysis; Identification of the main topic(s) covered by the document; Selection of the directory codes that correspond with the main topics previously identified; (b) Be as specific as possible. (c) Choose the directory code(s) which adjust better to the main topic(s); (d) Do not classify a document with two directory codes (general and specific) belonging to the same hierarchical line. It is possible to use various codes under the same domain but it is not possible to use the main domain and one of its subdivisions. Example - Correct: 03.20.30.00 Agriculture / Agricultural structural funds / European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development; 03.60.59.00 Agriculture / Products subject to market organisation / Oils and fats. Incorrect: 03.00.00.00 Agriculture; 03.07.00.00 Agriculture / Statistics. (e) Keep the end-user in mind. The directory codes are employed by the user for document retrieval therefore it is important to select the directory codes which have a potential value for the users. If a document is not correctly classified the user will get irrelevant results in its query. (f) Be careful with the \"General\" or \"Miscellaneous\" categories. These must be used only if no other subdivision is adequate for the classification of the document. An overuse of these categories leads to \"noise\" after a query (retrieval of numerous documents which are not relevant to the user).\n******Classification guidelines \u2013 How to assign directory codes: The first directory code to be assigned will conform to the following instructions: EU legislation must be based on an appropriate treaty provision which means that each institution must act within powers conferred by a treaty. The legal basis of EU legal acts is mentioned in the documents. This makes reference to the provision which confers competence to adopt the act in question. Treaty provisions are grouped under Treaty titles, chapters, sections or in protocols. Since the Directory codes cover the EU activities and competences, a correspondence can be set up between the Treaty titles, chapters, etc and the subdivision of the Directory. It means that the legal basis can be used as solid information to classify the legal acts and for this a correspondence table between the articles of TEU and TFEU and the Directory Codes has been created. If in the correspondence table there is a reference to one of the main domains in the Directory Codes (e.g. 01 General, financial and institutional matters) it means that, if possible, the classifier will have to choose the most specific subdivision within the main domain. If in the correspondence table there is a reference to more than one directory code the classifier must choose the most specific subdivision form each chapter or from the most adequate chapter of the Directory. The subsequent directory codes (if any) will be assigned following the basic classification principles previously mentioned. The legal basis of non-legislative acts makes reference to a basic act. In this case, the Treaty provision of this act has to be used for classification.

The title of an act amending earlier acts is a special case. The title is incomplete unless it refers by number to all the acts amended. Without such a reference, it is not possible to find all the amendments to a given act. If the sole purpose of the act in question is to amend another act, either the sequential reference number and title of the act to be amended or its sequential reference number and the specific purpose of the amendment is mentioned (see points 18.9 and 18.10). In contrast, if the act in question lays down autonomous provisions and consequently amends another act in a purely subsidiary manner, only the number of that act is given (see point 19.3).\n\n19. An act not primarily intended to amend another act may set out, at the end, amendments of other acts which are a consequence of changes which it introduces. Where the consequential amendments are substantial, a separate amending act should be adopted.\n\n19.1. Sometimes an act with autonomous provisions alters the legal context of a given field to such an extent that other acts governing other areas within the same field need to be amended. To the extent that the amendment is only secondary to the main scope of the act, the juxtaposition of autonomous and amending provisions in the same act does not fall within the prohibition set out in Guideline 18 on the inclusion of autonomous substantive provisions in amending acts.\nIn order for the amendment to be apparent, it must be mentioned in the title of the act, by stating the sequential reference number of the act to be amended (see point 8.3). Example: Council Directive 92/96/EEC of 10 November 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance and amending Directives 79/267/EEC and 90/619/EEC.\n\n******"}, "labels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Directory indicator"}, "notations": {"type": "literal", "value": "REP"}, "propertyCollectionLabels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Essential information"}, "propertyCollections": {"type": "literal", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/class_ESI"}, "propertyTypes": {"type": "literal", "value": "data property"}, "propertyURI": {"type": "uri", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/md_REP"}, "scopeNotes": {"type": "literal", "value": "This field has to be used for legislative and non-lagislative acts as well as for proposals of such acts.There are three possible values:\n\nREP  \u2013 appears in the Directory with a full title\n\nLIE  \u2013 appears in the Directory as a reference\n\nCADUC \u2013 stricken from the Directory (documents which should no more appear in the   directory; to be used for special cases and only when requested)\n\nThe field is mandatory for legislation, agreements and proposals.

(1) This praxis changed with IMMC \u2013 DGs name is available in both fields (32020M9900). (2) RS was opened also to other authors (not only COM anymore). However, the same value is not duplicated in AU (PE 21 2020 REV 1). (3) For some of other authors, there RS field is displayed differently on the results list and in the notice (see comment below - 16/2/2021). (4) Information about authors/responsible bodies is in immc provided by institutions in element cm:agent_work that might contain values indicating the following roles:\n\n\u2022 cm:agent_work[@role = \u2018AUT\u2019] is designated to be the author as cited elsewhere (usually like \u201cThe Commission said\u201d)\n\n\u2022 cm:agent_work[@role = \u2018RESP_CORP\u2019] is the the responsible service inside the author\u2019s organization (usually like \u2018drafted by\u2019)\n\n\u2022 cm:agent_work[@role = \u2018LEAD_CORP\u2019]\n\n(5) When receiving this immc element, it is linked in different ways to cdm properties, according to the chain and some other rules. \n\nBefore doing a correction, the following shall be analysed:  (a) Is there a need for  separated fields for AU and RS?; (b) If yes, what are the descriptions? For example  AU: is designated to be the author as cited elsewhere (usually like \u201cThe Commission said\u201d); RS: is the responsible service inside the author\u2019s organization (usually like \u2018drafted by\u2019). Based on this, we can do a basic cleaning (to be decided how).\n\nBut also the additional questions shall be answered: (c) Do we still also need field AS? If yes, what shall be the description?; (d) Can we try to clarify what shall be the meaning of @role = \u2018LEAD_CORP\u2019? (Is it needed?).\n\n\n16/2/2021: See als RSA - cdm#resource_legal_responsibility_of_agent. There are issues on EUR-Lex - AS is displayed on the results list, but not RSA. In the notice of EESC and COR, RSA is displayed, but not RS:\n\nEUR-Lex search field Service responsible (RS) field is linked to cdm properties cdm:resource_legal_service_responsible and cdm:resource_legal_responsibility_of_agent. Both properties (or only one of them) are available in various notices. The first property is displayed on the results list and in the notice as Department responsible, but only as a coded value. The second property is not displayed on the results list, but it is displayed for EECS and COR notices in document view as Responsible body.\n\nService responsible (RS) is linked to cdm:resource_legal_service_responsible; EUR-Lex x-path */NOTICE/WORK/SERVICE_RESPONSIBLE/VALUE. This metadata is searchable in the quick search as Service_responsible (RS) and it is displayed as Department responsible (51992PC0172). \n\nIt is not linked to any translation table, the values here are just strings and thus not translated on EUR-Lex. This metadata is searchable in the quick search as Service_responsible (RS).\n\nIn EURLEXNEW-3782, it was requested to display on EUR-Lex a new cdm property cdm:resource_legal_responsibility_of_agent that shal be available in EESC/COR notices (EUR-Lex x-path */NOTICE/WORK/RESOURCE_LEGAL_RESPONSIBILITY_OF_AGENT/URI/IDENTIFIER). This new property should be displayed notices covering documents from EESC/COR under Responsible body (but only in the notices, not on the results list). But on the results list the same notice contains Department responsible instead. This property is linked to corporate-body authority table and thus translated. In the same ticket, it was requested to add this new metadata under Service responsible (RS) search field.\n\nIn the meantime the new property cdm:resource_legal_responsibility_of_agent has been added to different documents form Commission, Council, etc. - 52020DC0235, 31993D0683, 31984R0273). As the display of this property is restricted only to EESC/COR documents, it is not displayed in any other documents even if being available. \n\nProposal: (1) Keep Service responsible linked to both properties and display both properties on the results list as well as in the document view for all notices. (2) Remove cdm:resource_legal_service_responsible  from notices in cellar and replace it by cdm:resource_legal_responsibility_of_agent. (3) Remove cdm:resource_legal_service_responsible  from EUR-Lex and display cdm:resource_legal_responsibility_of_agent everywhere as \u201cResponsible body\u201d + rename the expert search field RS to \u201cResponsible body\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "examples": {"type": "literal", "value": "cdm:proposal_act_service_responsible rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\"\u003eSANCO\u003c/cdm:proposal_act_service_responsible\u003e"}, "labels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Department responsible"}, "notations": {"type": "literal", "value": "RS"}, "propertyCollectionLabels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Additional information"}, "propertyCollections": {"type": "literal", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/class_ADI"}, "propertyTypes": {"type": "literal", "value": "object property"}, "propertyURI": {"type": "uri", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/md_RS"}, "scopeNotes": {"type": "literal", "value": "The fields contain codes corresponding to the acronyms of the Commission DG\u0027s.

It shall also review the legality of acts of bodies, offices or agencies of the Union intended to produce legal effects vis-\u00e0-vis third parties.\n\n******\n\n4/ In the Section 6 with the title \u201cEuropean Central Bank\u201d  the Article 282 (5) specifies:\n\n******\n\n5. Within the areas falling within its responsibilities, the European Central Bank shall be consulted on all proposed Union acts, and all proposals for regulation at national level, and may give an opinion.\n\n******\n\nNB: There is only the obligation to consult the ECB, but there is no obligation of the ECB to give an opinion. Following the analysed opinions the ECB makes its own selection of the topics or proposals, but always in its fields of competence/responsibilities.\n\n\nProtocol (No 4) on the Statute of the European System Of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank\n\n1/ In the Article 4 (Advisory functions)  we can read:\n\n\n******\nIn accordance with Article 127(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union:\n\n(a) the ECB shall be consulted:\n\u2014 on any proposed Union act in its fields of competence;\n\u2014 by national authorities regarding any draft legislative provision in its fields of competence, but within the limits and under the conditions set out by the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41;\n\n(b) the ECB may submit opinions to the Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies or to national authorities on matters in its fields of competence.\n\n******\n\n2/ In the Chapter V (Prudential Supervision), Article 25 (Prudential supervision) point 25.1 :\n\n******\n\n25.1. The ECB may offer advice to and be consulted by the Council, the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States on the scope and implementation of Union legislation relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and to the stability of the financial system.\n\n******\n\n3/ In the Chapter VII General Provisions the Article 34 (Legal acts) is stipulated:\n\n******\n\n34.1. In accordance with Article 132 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the ECB shall:\n\n\u2014 make regulations to the extent necessary to implement the tasks defined in Article 3.1, first indent, Articles 19.1, 22 or 25.2 and in cases which shall be laid down in the acts of the Council referred to in Article 41;\n\n\u2014 take decisions necessary for carrying out the tasks entrusted to the ESCB under these Treaties and this Statute;\n\n\u2014 make recommendations and deliver opinions.\n\n******\n\nConclusion: ECB opinions are not binding and cannot be enforceable nor reviewed by the Court of Justice.\n\n31/01/2020 - CADMOS-9634: Rules for creation of in-force indicator are describet in that ticket.

Automatically created in cellar for notices fulfilling the following criteria: (a) celex number is available (cdm:resource_legal_id_celex); (b) celex sector is not equal to 5 (cdm:resource_legal_id_sector); (c) date of effect is available (cdm:resource_legal_date_entry-into-force); (d) end of validity date is available (cdm:resource_legal_date_end-of-validity); (e) there is no value \u201cEPH\u201d in cdm:manifestation_official-journal_part_durability (EPH is used for ephemeral acts).\n\n2. Value true is created when: (a) Date of effect (or at least one) \u003c= current date; (b) Date of effect (in case there is only one) is not equal to 01/01/1001; (c) End of validity (or at least one) \u003e current date\n\n3. Value false is created when: (a) Date of effect (the only one available) = 01/01/1001; (b) Date of effect (or all of them) \u003e current date; (c) End of validity date (or all of them) \u003c current date (and \u003e 1003-03-03)\n\nIn force indicator shall be created/updated automatically whenever any of the above mentioned conditions changes. But this does not work fully correctly and there are regularly manual updates done. \n\n******EUR-Lex:  cdm:resource_legal_in-force  is on EUR-Lex available under x-path */NOTICE/WORK/RESOURCE_LEGAL_IN-FORCE/VALUE; related expert search field is In_force_indicator (VV).\n\nVV is searchable, but not directly displayed on the results list/in the notice. For display purposes, there was a virtual EUR-Lex field created combining VV, date of entry into force (IF) and date of notification (NF) was created. By this change, we are able to distinguish between acts being no more in force and not yet in force (EURLEXNEW-3087). There is no inforce indicator displayed for documents having NF=01/01/1001 (EURLEXNEW-3234):\n\nGreen: In force \u2013 query: VV=true NOT NF=01/01/1001\n\nYellow: Not yet in force \u2013query: (VV=false AND EV\u003eTODAY) NOT NF=01/01/1001\n\nRed: No longer in force \u2013 query: (VV=false AND EV\u003cTODAY) NOT NF=01/01/1001\n\nThis virtual field is also searchable from the expert search as VV2 (with values IN_FORCE, NOT_YET_IN_FORCE, NO_MORE_IN_FORCE). However, this implementation brought some inconsistency between search and display.\n\nIssues: (i) some delayed updates in cellar; (ii) there is sometimes wrong value attributed because of mistakes in start of validity / end of validity date. Such mistakes are much more visible since the three colors schema has been introduced in EUR-Lex (more users point to such mistakes); (iii) we are not able to attribute VV to ephemeral acts (it is difficult to match repealing acts with repealed acts; some of the acts might become no more in force before finalization of the legal analysis); (iv) value EPH in cdm:manifestation_official-journal_part_durability  seems to be problematic in some cases (there are some mistakes); (v) methodological issues \u2013 we do not attribute VV anymore to sector 5, but ECB asked to do it (e-mail is attached)\n"}, "skosDefinitions": {"type": "literal", "value": "Indicator whether a piece of legislation still in force or not in force."}, "types": {"type": "literal", "value": "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept"}}, {"labels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Link: Inapplicability request"}, "notations": {"type": "literal", "value": "INAPPLICAB_REQ"}, "propertyCollectionLabels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Case affecting"}, "propertyCollections": {"type": "literal", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/class_AJ"}, "propertyTypes": {"type": "literal", "value": "object property"}, "propertyURI": {"type": "uri", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/md_INAPPLICAB_REQ"}, "skosDefinitions": {"type": "literal", "value": "Inapplicability request (IL)\n\nThis is a link from announcements on EU case law published in the Official Journal (infromation about new case) to the legal act(s) that are requested to be declared as inapplicable by the Court decision."}, "types": {"type": "literal", "value": "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept"}}, {"editorialNotes": {"type": "literal", "value": "02/05/2015: There are currently two fields duplicating the same information \u2013 DB (date of debate) and VO (date of vote).

REPEAL\n\nThe repeal of an act or of certain of its provisions means that it/they cease( s) to be in force, either because the arrangements that it/they introduced expire or are replaced by other arrangements, or because the whole act, including all its successive amendments is replaced by a codified/recasted act (*).\n\nRegulation ...... [and Regulation ...... taken in implementation thereof] shall be repealed. 1\n\nArticle 3 of Regulation ...... shall be repealed.\n\nNB: In these two cases it is understood that the repeal takes effect on the date of entry into force or, where appropriate, the date of application of the repealing act.\n\nRegulation ...... shall be repealed with effect from ...... [date on which the repealing+AF21\n\nRegulation is brought into effect].\n\nNB: In that case, the repeal shall take effect on a date which differs from that of the entry into force of the repealing act.\n\n(*) \"Consolidating act\" from the original version was replaced by \"a codified/recasted act.\n\n************\n\n28/02/2017: Ephemeral acts, fisheries - prohibition of fishing\n\nChange of the methodology for ephemeral acts \u2013 EV not to be created.\nDocuments related to prohibition of fishing \u2013 there should be a real EV date inserted, based on the text.\n\n29/06/2017: Information from SJ concerning validity of delegated/implementing acts\n\nA delegated/implementing/comitology act does not automatically get repealed on the repeal of the basic legislative act on the basis of which it got adopted. An act is valid if its legal basis was valid at the time of adoption of the act. Such a delegated/implementing/comitology act would need to be specifically repealed by the Commission\n\n15/03/2019: Association agreements \u2013 new Member States\n \nNotices covering the associationagreements with new MS  contain value 31/12/9999 in EV date. Therefore, the in force indicator says \"In force\".\nWe assume the EV date should be equal to the date of accession (minus 1 day); but this assumption has not been confirmed by any relevant authority.\nBased on this, it was decided to remove EV field from such notices. SeeLAAION-540. Examples: 22005A0617(02), 22005A0617(01), 22003A0515(01), 21993A1231(18), 21993A1231(15)\n\n29/09/2016: GIL-GM Amended proposal \u2013 end of validity date of the initial proposal\n\nCommission proposal can be amended a couple of times and that such amended proposals are published as separate notices on EUR-Lex. The questions is whether the end of validity date of the initial proposal can be understood as being the date of the adoption of the 1st amended proposal (minus 1 day) and whether the end of validity date of the 1st amended proposal can be understood as being the date of the adoption of the second amended proposal (minus 1 day)? Or should the first and second amended proposals be understood only as texts amending the initial proposal but not replacing it? The amended proposals can contain only the amendments or the amendments plus the original proposal, depending on the case-by-case basis. \nThe participants agreed that both the initial proposal and the amended proposal(s) should keep having the fictional date of end of validity (implying that they are \"pending\"), until a final act is adopted. After this, the date of adoption of the final act becomes the date of end of validity of both the initial proposal and amended proposals. \n\n12/03/2019: GIL-GM Follow-up of Court\u0027s decisions on annulment (P/12032019/4a)\n\nThe legal analysis methodology does not follow up on the annulments of legal acts by judgments of the Court of Justice. Currently the date of end of validity of those acts remains indefinite; therefore, they remain marked as \u0027in force\u0027.\nThe Commission Legal Service was consulted and considered that the effect should be as if it had never existed, therefore the value contained in the date of effect field should be reproduced in the date of end of validity, and the in force indicator switched to \u0027not in force\u0027. The participants agreed on this solution and indicated that the comment \u0027declared void by\u0027 should be shown below the title, next to the in force indicator coloured point.\nThis solution should also be applied to cases where the judgment annuls the decision but orders to maintain the effects of the decision in force. Example 62011CJ0658: \n\n******\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby\n   \n1. Annuls Council Decision 2011/640/CFSP of 12 July 2011 on the signing and conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Mauritius on the conditions of transfer of suspected pirates and associated seized property from the European Union-led naval force to the Republic of Mauritius and on the conditions of suspected pirates after transfer;   \n\n2. Orders that the effects of Decision 2011/640 be maintained in force\n\n******\n\n12/03/2019: GIL-GM End of validity of international agreements when the decision on the signing was declared void by CdJ (P/12032019/4b)\nThe OP raised the question on how to proceed when the Court annuls the decision on the signing of an agreement. The participants agreed that in both decision and agreement cases the value corresponding to the date of entry into force should be set in the date of end of validity field.\nSee for example https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?qid=1571896291605\u0026uri=CELEX:22011A0930(01)"}, "examples": {"type": "literal", "value": "\u003ccdm:resource_legal_date_end-of-validity rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date\"\u003e9999-12-31\u003c/cdm:resource_legal_date_end-of-validity\u003e"}, "labels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Date of end of validity"}, "notations": {"type": "literal", "value": "EV"}, "propertyCollectionLabels": {"type": "literal", "value": "Dates properties"}, "propertyCollections": {"type": "literal", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/class_DPROP"}, "propertyTypes": {"type": "literal", "value": "data property"}, "propertyURI": {"type": "uri", "value": "http://publications.europa.eu/resources/authority/lam/md_EV"}, "scopeNotes": {"type": "literal", "value": "These are the possible cases according to the nature of particular acts:\n\n(a) Acts of limited duration: The date of end of validity mentioned in the act.

There is no impact to the end of validity date if only a part of the act is repealed by a subsequent act (partial repeal).\n\n(g) Acts that by their nature have no end of validity: Fictional date 9999-12-31.\n\n(h) Legislative proposals (drafts, MS initiatives, drafts of general/amending budgets): Fictional date 9999-12-31, to be changed into a factual date when the proposal is adopted (date of adoption of the pursuant legislative act); withdrawn (date of the document stating the\nwithdrawal); rejected (date when the proposal was rejected) or replaced (date of adoption of the\namended proposal).\n\n(i) Acts listed as obsolete in documents from sector 5: Date of validity of obsolete acts = sector 5 document publication date.\n\n***Example 32002R1429 listed in 52011XC1108(01): Date of document: 02/08/2002 + Date of effect: 01/07/2002; Implementation See Art 7 + Date of effect: 06/08/2002; Entry into force Date pub. +3 See Art 7 + End of validity date: 08/11/2011; Obsolete See 52011XC1108(01) P 1\n\n(j) Acts related to the budget and to the specific financial year: Such acts have only limited duration (until the end of the relevant financial year).\n\n***Example 32011B0840: Date of document: 28/10/2011 + Date of effect: 01/01/2011; Entry into force Financial year 2011 + End of validity date: 31/12/2011; Financial year 2011\n\n(k) Acts related to the common agricultural policy or fisheries and to the specific marketing year: Such acts have only limited duration (until the end of the relevant marketing year. Definition of the marketing year could be find in article 6 of 32013R1308). The same rule and comment should be applied for all acts referring to the specific fishing season (31972R2825).\n\n***Example 32009R0274 (Commission Regulation (EC) No 274/2009 of 2 April 2009 fixing the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2009/2010 marketing year): Date of document: 02/04/2009 + Date of effect: 10/04/2009; Entry into force Date pub. + 7 See Art 3 + Date of effect: 01/10/2009; Implementation See Art 3 + End of validity date: 30/09/2010; End of season 2009/2010 (comment + year)\n\n***Example 32016R2361: Article 1 Quota exhaustion: The fishing quota allocated to the Member State referred to in the Annex to this Regulation for the stock referred to therein for 2016 shall be deemed to be exhausted from the date set out in that Annex. \n\nDate of document: 15/12/2016; Date of adoption + Date of effect: 23/12/2016; Entry into force Date pub. +1 See Art 3 + End of validity date: 31/12/2016; Period of reference 2016 (comment + year)\n\nIf it is not possible to determinate the exact dates of the marketing/fishing year and if the\napplication of the act is not directly related to the marketing/fishing year, the end of validity should be a fictional date 9999-12-31.\n\n(l) Ephemeral acts (acts related to day-to-day management of agricultural measures whose titles are printed in light type in OJ cover page): Such acts are generally valid only for a limited period and are automatically repealed by subsequent acts. For such acts, EV field should not be created. There is no in force indicator for ephemeral acts. \n\n(m) Regulations opening an invitation to tender for specific agricultural products: End of validity date is usually mentioned in the provisions (The invitation should be open until DD/MM/YYYY).\n\n(n) Acts concerning the appointments of members for a defined period: End of validity date is equal to the last day of the period mentioned in the provisions.\n\n***Example 32014D0047 Date of document: 28/01/2014 + Date of effect: 28/01/2014; Entry into force Date of document See Art 2 + End of validity date: 25/01/2015; End of term of office See Art. 1\n\n(o) Anti-dumping measures (explained below in Exceptions and special cases)\n\n(p) Documents from sector 5: End of validity date is mainly applicable to proposals, drafts, MS initiatives (see point (d) above) or ECB recommendations. For different documents from the decision-making process other than proposals, the EV date is applicable only for exceptional cases (e.g. EP legislative resolution repealing/replacing the previous one; no examples in the database).\n\n(q) Acts repealed by a subsequent act - End of validity date of repealed acts\n\nA. Acts repealed by acts which should be notified: An act is repealed by another act whose legal value depends of the date of notification. If the notification date is not yet known, the end of validity date of the repealed act should have the following value, accompanied by the comment repealed by and the mention of the repealing act: Date of document: 12/12/2013 + Date of effect: 08/01/2014; Entry into force Date pub. +20 See Art 2 End of validity date: 31/12/9999 ; Repealed by 32011D0395. That date is to be modified once the notification date of the amending act is known and implemented in its notice.\n\nB. Acts declared null and void by a corrigendum: In such cases, the end of validity date is equal to the date of publication of the first act (and not to the date of the corrigendum). Such formation must be completed by the creation of an active relation corrigendum corrected act (for the comment to be added, see Relations).\n\n***Example 32013R1363, published in OJ L 343 of 19.12.2013 (before the corrigendum was\npublished): Date of document: 12/12/2013 + Date of effect: 08/01/2014; Entry into force Date pub. +20 See Art 2 + End of validity date: 31/12/9999\n\n***Example 32013R1363R(01) (corrigendum published in OJ L 343 of 20 December 2013) declares the publication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1363/2013 to be considered null and void.\n\n***Example 32013R1363 (after the corrigendum 32013R1363R(01) was published): Date of document: 12/12/2013 Date of effect: 08/01/2014; Entry into force Date pub. +20 See Art 2 End of validity date: 19/12/2013 See 32013R1363R(01)\n\nC. Implicitly repealed amending acts\n\n*Basic act: Any act from sector 2, 3, 4 or 5 which has subsequently been modified.\n\n*Amending act: Any act which fully or partially modifies the basic act to which it relates. An amending act can be composed either of provisions which only relate to one basic act (\"notautonomous provisions\") or of provisions which relate to more than one or to none basic act, and which produce a legal effect of their own (autonomous provisions). An amending act is deemed implicitly repealed when the basic act to which it relates is repealed and does not explicitly mention that its successive amendments are also repealed, as long as the amending does not contain any autonomous provisions.\n\nThe end of validity date of the amending act should be the same as the one of the repealed basic act. The information must be completed by the creation of an active relation act repealing the basic act amending act (for implicitly repeals, see Relations). See also comment (21/9/2015) Implicitly repealed amending acts information form the Legal Service.\n\n(h) Anti-dumping measures: A definitive anti-dumping measure shall expire five years from its imposition or five years from the date of conclusion of the most recent review (Council regulation (EC) No 1225/2009, art. 11.2). \n\nThere are two basic scenarios for the amendments concerning the end of validity date of an implementing measure:\n\n******Scenario 1\n\n(i) Publication of: Basic implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty: Date of application = 01-01-2014+  End of validity date = 31-12-2018\n\n(ii) Publication of: Implementing regulation amending the basic regulation (not repealing or amending the validity): Date of application = DD-MM-YYYY + End of validity date = 31-12-2018\n\n(iii) Publication of: Notice of the impending expiry of certain anti-dumping measures (Published in OJ before the expiry of the basic regulation.) No change needed for the end of validity of the basic implementing regulation or the amending regulation.\n\n\n******Scenario 2 (the dates in EV date are to be used successively, following the sequence of events described below)\n\n(i) Publication of: Basic implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty: Date of application = 01-01-2014 + End of validity date = 31-12-2018\n\n(ii) Publication of: Implementing regulation amending the basic regulation (repealing or amending the validity, in this case to 31-12-2019): Date of application = DD-MM-YYYY + End of validity date = 31-12-2019 + change of the end of validity date of the basic implementing regulation to be done\n\n(iii) Publication of: Notice of initiation of partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures. The basic implementing regulation should remain in force pending of the outcome of the review. The end of validity date of the basic and amending implementing regulations has to be changed, until the review is published (should be changed to 31-12-9999).\n\n(iv) Publication of: New basic implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty: Date of application = 01-04-2020 + End of validity date = 31-03-2025. The end of validity date of the basic (A) and amending implementing (B) regulations has to be changed to the definitive date (31-03-2020 date of application of the new basic regulation minus one day).\n"}, "skosDefinitions": {"type": "literal", "value": "It is the date on which the act ceases to be valid.

Index the content of the document: use thesaurus terms for document content indexation and not for classification: The thesaurus is an indexing tool. Indexing consists of representing the content of the document with selected descriptors of a thesaurus in the purpose of document retrieval. Indexation does not consist of classifying documents according to their main subject(s) with a classification scheme or a subject heading list. Indexation with thesaurus terms is often contrasted to classification with a classification scheme. Classification consists of assigning documents to one ore more categories based on their main topics. \n2. Follow the three stages of indexing: Indexation is a complex, intellectual decision process including the following steps.\n1.2.1 examining the document (intellectual analysis): In order to be able to analyse the content of documents, indexer should have adequate knowledge of the field covered by the document. Indexer should understand the concepts and main ideas encountered in the document.\n1.2.2 identifying the principal concepts and the essential elements of the document: In order to be able to select the concepts which have a potential value for the users, indexer should know the purpose for which the indexing terms will be used (document retrieval).\n1.2.3 expressing the selected concepts in thesaurus terms: In order to be able to represent the selected concepts with thesaurus terms, indexer should have adequate knowledge of the vocabulary he/she is using (structure, preferred terms and non-preferred terms, cross-relations, etc). Since the meaning of a descriptor is clarified by the thesaurus itself (by the relations of a term with other descriptors), indexer is asked to always examine the contextual and semantic environment of the descriptors: (a) Domain; (b) Microtheasurus; (c) USE/UF \u2013 preferred terms and non-preferred terms; (d) Top term and narrow terms; (e) Related terms; (f) Notes\n3. Be as specific as possible: When indexing, the most specific term available in the thesaurus should be selected to represent the given concept. It means that (a) the descriptor chosen to represent the selected concept of the document should be at the same level of specificity as the selected concept; (b) if the thesaurus has no descriptor at the same level of specificity as the selected concept, the descriptor at the next higher level should be chosen (descriptor which is closest to the concept). Loss of specificity occurs when a particular concept of a document is represented by an indexing term with more general meaning while an indexing term at the same level of specificity is available in the thesaurus.\nExceptions: In some special cases, indexing at a more general level than the selected concept may be justified. For example, (a) when very specific concepts occur only casually or in the fringe area of the document, but the main part of the document is at general level; (b) when a (long) document covers a lot of specific area (all the specific EU policies or all countries, etc.) which can be summarized in one or more generic terms.\n4. Do not index simultaneously with several descriptors (specific and general) belonging to the same hierarchical line:The reasons for not indexing simultaneously with two or more descriptors belonging to the same hierarchy are following: (a) it avoids multiple, redundant indexing; (b) broader indexing terms are linked to the more specific ones by the hierarchical tree structure of the thesaurus \u2013 ascending and/or descending (auto)posting is possible. (In EUR-Lex, if the user searches for a generic term, all the documents indexed with one  of its narrower terms will be found). N.B.: Descriptors on the same hierarchical level and related terms can be used simultaneously.\n5. Prefer pre-coordinated descriptors to \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors or to the combination of two or more simple descriptors: Pre-coordinated descriptors have been created in order to be able to represent with only one descriptor a complex, compound concept, instead of being obliged to combine several simple descriptors. The use of pre-coordinated descriptors gives better results in document retrieval than the combination of descriptors. If there is no pre-coordinated descriptor in a thesaurus which can represent the selected compound concept, indexer should try to express it through the combination of two or more simple descriptors. \n6. Use geographical descriptors: If the geographical context of a document is clearly mentioned or a document deals specifically with a country, region or an international organization, use thesaurus geographical descriptors. \n7. Indexing should not concern the physical entity of the document: Type of document, author or any other metadata which do not concern the content of the document should not be indexed with thesaurus terms. This information is covered by other metadata. \n8. Achieve indexing consistency: Within a large indexing team, a centralized checking stage is recommended to be set up and the creation of flexible templates can be good solutions for achieving indexing consistency.\n******Part II:  Applying the general indexing principles: concrete rules and examples from the already indexed EUR-Lex documentary collection\n1. Use EuroVoc for indexation and the Directory code and Subject headings for classification: While indexing with EuroVoc, indexer should keep in mind the different purpose and the use of an indexing tool and a classification tool. The systematic use of general EuroVoc terms (most frequently top terms) can easily result in classifying the documents instead of indexing them, so their use should be limited to documents at very general level and only to documents that really speak about the selected general descriptor. This principle is in line with the principle that the most specific EuroVoc term should be used. Before assigning a general term (top term) to a document, indexer is asked to examine whether one of its specific term corresponds better to the content of the document. Classifying instead of indexing may occur not only at top terms level but at specific level as well. To avoid this, indexer is always asked to verify before assigning a descriptor to a document whether the chosen descriptor really corresponds to the content of the document (indexation) or only classifies the document by referring to its main subject(s) (classification).\ni) 32011D0302: Council implementing decision 2011/302/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Syria\nThis document concerns in general the common foreign and security policy. In this case the descriptor CFSP was used to classify the document (see classification under the Directory code and Subject matter). EUROVOC descriptor: international sanctions / human rights / CFSP / restriction of liberty; Directory code: 18.00.00.00 Common Foreign and Security Policy; Subject matter: Common foreign and security policy \nii) 32011D0019(01): Decision of the European Central Bank of 15 November 2011 amending Decision ECB/2007/7 concerning the terms and conditions of TARGET2-ECB (ECB/2011/19)\nThis document concerns in general the European Monetary Union. In this case the descriptor Economic and Monetary Union was used to classify the document (see classification under the Directory code and Subject matter). EUROVOC descriptor: Economic and Monetary Union / electronic banking / intra-Community payment ; Directory code: 10.30.30.00 Economic and monetary policy and free movement of capital / Economic policy / Economic and monetary union; Subject matter: Economic and Monetary Union, European Central Bank, Euro\n2. Follow the three stages of indexing: If the three intellectual stages of the indexation process are not respected, it may lead to some typical indexation errors and may negatively affect the performance of the query. These errors are following:\nA. Missing descriptors: If descriptors are missing, the query system will not retrieve the relevant documents answering to the users\u0027 query. There will be an information loss or \u0027silence\u0027 and descriptor has to be added. Missing descriptors occurs due to imperfection (a) either in identification of the essential concepts with a potential value for the users during document analysis; (b) or in translation of these identified concepts into EuroVoc descriptors. If there is no descriptor in EuroVoc corresponding to the selected concept (neither at the same level of specificity, nor at the next higher level), indexer should try to represent the given concept by the combination of several existing descriptors. If it is not possible, propositions can be sent to the OP by using the \u0027Contribute\u0027 menu of the EuroVoc website in order to include a new descriptor in EuroVoc.\ni) 2011CN0414: Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Polimeles Protodikio Athinon (Greece) lodged on 8 August 2011\nThis document concerns questions, which should be clarified by the Court of Justice: \"Under Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement are chemical and pharmaceutical products patentable subject matter provided that they satisfy the requirements for the grant of patents and, if so, what is the scope of their protection?\". Descriptor TRIPS \u2013 the main descriptors which should be used to cover the subject of the document \u2013 was missing (EUROVOC descriptor: European patent / patent law / chemical product / pharmaceutical product). \nii) 32011R1004: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1004/2011 of 11 October 2011 amending the representative prices and additional import duties for certain products in the sugar sector fixed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 971/2011 for the 2011/12 marketing year\nOne of the main descriptors (\"representative price\") was missing (EUROVOC descriptor: Community import / raw sugar / CCT duties / beet sugar / cane sugar) \niii) 32011D0634: Council Decision of 17 May 2011 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the International Cocoa Agreement 2010\nOne of the main descriptors (\"signature of an agreement\") was missing. If a document concerns an agreement, also the type and the field (EC trade agreement) of the agreement should be expressed by indexing terms \u2013 see also Annex III (Descriptors clarification), EC agreement (EUROVOC descriptor: sustainable development(*) / economic growth(*)  / cocoa).  (*) In this case too general descriptors were used. See point 2.3 (Be as specific as possible).\nB. Incorrect descriptors: If descriptors are incorrectly used (not relevant, out of context), the query system will retrieve several but irrelevant documents, there will be a \u0027noise\u0027 \uf0e0 In that case, incorrect descriptors have to be deleted. \nThe use of incorrect descriptors is due to (a) either the misunderstanding of the content of the document; (b) or to the defect in examining the contextual and semantic environment of the selected descriptor (non-preferred terms, related terms, hierarchy, notes) which may lead to the misunderstanding of the selected descriptor. Theoretically, the semantic environment of a descriptor helps to clarify the meaning of a descriptor, but if it is not the case, clarification and additional notes to a EuroVoc term can be demanded from the OP. \ni) 620091TA00118: Case T-118/09: Judgment of the General Court of 5 October 2011 \u2014 La Sonrisa de Carmen and Bloom Clothes v OHIM \u2014 Heldmann (BLOOMCLOTHES) \nEUROVOC descriptor: real estate business / European trademark / registered trademark. This document concerns the trademark law. The subject of commercial activity of the companies \u2013 parties to the action \u2013 is not specified in the text. Anyway, the name of the trademark in question (Blomclothes) could indicate the field of the business activity \u2013 clothing. For more information a more detailed searching is needed in this case (related documents, web sites of the companies etc.).\nii) 52011XC1011(04): Commission communication pursuant to Article 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community\nEUROVOC descriptor: public servi / invitatice / invitation to tender / inland transport / air transport /Greece. This document concerns an invitation to tender for providing service of general interest (air transport). The descriptor \"public services\" refers to \"the body providing a service\" (see SN). Descriptor \"services of general interest\" should be used in this case.\niii) 52011DC0666: Communication from the Commission to the European parliament and the Council: Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2011-2012\nEUROVOC descriptor: Albania / Community acquis / Turkey / ISPA / accession criteria / Macedonia. Macedonia is a region of Greece. This communication concerns the \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\".\n3. Be as specific as possible: According to the general indexing principle, the most specific EuroVoc term should be selected. If a document is indexed at a higher/more general level than the level of specificity of the selected concept, it will generate \u2018noises\u2019 and user will get irrelevant results.\ni) 32011D0739: Council Decision of 20 October 2011 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein amending the Additional Agreement between the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein extending to the Principality of Liechtenstein the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\nEUROVOC descriptor: Liechtenstein / foodstuff / EC agreement / designation of origin / Switzerland / agricultural product / ratification of an agreement. The more specific descriptor \"EC trade agreement\" should be used in this case. \"EC agreement\" and \"EC trade agreement\" belongs to the same hierarchical line. \"EC trade agreement is the NT of \u0027EC agreement\".\nii) 62006FB0105: Case F-105/06: Order of the Civil Service Tribunal (First Chamber) of 27 September 2011 \u2014 L\u00fcbking and Others v Commission\nThe case concerns: \"Annulment of the Commission\u2019s decision published in Administrative Notices No 85 2005 of 23 November 2005 in so far as it provided for promotion of the applicants to grade A*9 and not grade A*10 in the 2005 promotion exercise.\"\nEUROVOC descriptor: equal treatment / appointment of staff / professional career / staff assessment / European official. The more specific descriptor \"promotion\" should be used in this case. \"Professional career\" and \"promotion\" belong to the same hierarchical line. \"Promotion\" is the NT of \"Professional career\". \niii)32011R1136: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1136/2011 of 9 November 2011 establishing the standard import values for determining the entry price of certain fruit and vegetables\n EUROVOC descriptor: fruit / Community import / vegetable / import price / common organisation of markets. Ephemeral documents usually contain (in their annexes) the concrete product names or the Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes of the products concerned by the act. Indexer is asked to use the most specific descriptor corresponding to the products and not only descriptors referring to the category of the concerned products. More specific descriptors (citrus fruit, grape, pip fruit and fruit vegetable) should be used in this case. \nIf EuroVoc has no descriptor at the same level of specificity as the selected concept, the descriptor at the next higher level should be chosen: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 388/2011 of 19 April 2011 concerning the authorisation of maduramicin ammonium alpha as a feed additive for chickens for fattening (holder of authorisation Alpharma (Belgium) BVBA) and amending Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 Text with EEA relevance: Since EuroVoc has no descriptor for \u2018maduramicin ammonium\u2019 (which is an antibiotic), use the descriptor at the next higher level. In some cases, specific terms are considered in EuroVoc as non-preferred terms of generic terms. (e.g. name of classes and their components \u2013 reptile NPT crocodile).\n4. Simultaneous use of several descriptors belonging to the same hierarchical line: Before indexers select a Eurovoc term, they should navigate the content of the thesaurus and analyze the hierarchical relationships of the selected terms. It will alert them to the existence of a more or a less generic term belonging to the same hierarchical line: if both of them suits to the content of the document, the most specific one should be used.\ni) 32011R0418: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 418/2011 of 28 April 2011 amending the representative prices and additional import duties for certain products in the sugar sector fixed by Regulation (EU) No 867/2010 for the 2010/11 marketing year\nEUROVOC descriptor: sugar product / syrup / representative price / CCT duties. Descriptors sugar product and syrup belong to the same hierarchical line. The most specific should be chosen.\nii) 62011CN0454: Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Latvijas Republikas Augst\u0101k\u0101s tiesas Sen\u0101ta Adminsitrat\u012bvo (Republic of Latvia) lodged on 1 September 2011 \u2014 Gun\u0101rs Pusts v Lauku atbalsta dienests\nEUROVOC descriptor: aid recipient / terms of aid / aid system. Descriptors aid recipient and aid system belong to the same hierarchical line. The most specific should be chosen.\n5. Prefer pre-coordinated descriptors to \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors or to the combination of two or more \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors: EuroVoc, originally built up specifically for processing the documentary collection of the EU institutions, contains a large number of pre-coordinated descriptors in the field of EU activities. These pre-coordinated descriptors (e.g. \u2018import (EU)\u2019) exist in parallel with \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors (e.g. \u2018import\u2019), either with a hierarchical relationship between them (same hierarchical line) or as related terms, belonging to different top terms or microthesauri. Giving preference to the use of pre-coordinated EuroVoc descriptors is essential since it affects the performance of the query results. In EUR-Lex, there are an important number of documents that requires pre-coordinated descriptors. If EuroVoc does not contain the necessary pre-coordinated descriptor, propositions can be sent to the OP via the Contribute menu of Euro.\nExamples of pre-coordinated descriptors:\n(A) appointment of staff (in general, BT personnel administration). Do not use this descriptors for indexing a document about the appointments in EU institutions/bodies Ex: 32011D0243; appointment of members \u2013 pre-coordinated \u2013 use only for the appointments in EU institutions, bodies, agencies\n(B) budget financing \u2013 resources of a budget (national budget, budget of an organisation, etc.): financing of the EU budget \u2013 pre-coordinated  \u2013 concerns the different types of resources of the EU (Where does the money come from? How is EU budget is financed?) \n(C) import Ex: 32011R0385; import (EU) pre-coordinated\n(D) export  Ex:  52011PC0245; export (EU) pre-coordinated\n(E) bilateral agreement \u2013 See SN \u2013 use for documents about agreement between two States Ex: 52011SC0640; EC agreement \u2013 pre-coordinated \u2013  use for documents about agreement between the EU in one part + third country or (international) organisation in combination with the country name or the organisation\u0027s name. If possible, use specific pre-coordinated descriptors for the different types of EU agreements (European association agreement, association agreement (EU), cooperation agreement (EU), interim agreement (EU), trade agreement (EU), negotiation of an agreement (EU)) EX: 32011D0334\n(F) action programme \u2013 BT management (UF framework programme, plan of action, work programme) Do not use for EU programmes Ex: 52011AE0533; EU programme \u2013 pre-coordinated\n6. Use geographical descriptors: Domain 72 Geograpy of EuroVoc contains geographical descriptors. Use descriptors of countries when a document concerns specifically one or more countries or examines a particular situation in a given country. For example: (a) agreement with a country; (b) action against a State / judgment of a court concerning a country; (c) national statistics;  (d) state aid regime of a country / authorization of State aid; (e) EU financing expenditure in a State; (f) origin of a product; (g) national law of a State \nGroup of countries / international organisations: If the document speaks about group of countries or international organisations as a whole, do not list the name of the member countries, but use only the descriptor concerning the group from the domain 76 International organisations. However, if needed, country names and descriptors referring to an organisation/group of country can be used simultaneously since they do not belong to the same hierarchical line and domain. \n52010XG0415(01): Notice for the attention of the persons, entities and bodies to which restrictive measures provided for in Council Decision 2011/239/CFSP apply\nEUROVOC descriptor: international sanctions / economic sanctions / natural person. A geographical descriptor is missing (Myanmar). Restrictive measures are provided against Burma/Myanmar. \nRegions: Only the names of regions of EU Member States are in EuroVoc, but not those of third countries. Use regions\u0027 names when a document is specifically about a region of an EU Member State. If needed, regions names can be used together with country names since they do not belong to the same hierarchical line. \n52010X0416(03): Summary information communicated by Member States on State aid granted \nEUROVOC descriptor: Italy / fishing industry / aid system / control of State aid / small and medium-sized enterprises / aquaculture / State aid. A geographical descriptor is missing (Sardegne). State aid was granted by the \u0027Regione Autonoma della Sardegna\u0027.\n7. Physical entity of the document: Indexation of the EUR-Lex documentary collection with EuroVoc should not concern the type and/or the author of the document. This information are covered by other metadata, EuroVoc descriptors should be only used to index the content of the document.\nAuthor: The use of \u2018institutions\u2019 descriptors (EU institutions, bodies, services, organisations, agencies and international organizations) should be limited to documents which are about: (a) the functioning of an institution (rules of procedures, composition, appointment, etc.); (b) the competencies of an institution; (c) the role of an institution; (d) the activity of an institution; (e) agreements, cooperation between institutions. Do not use \u2018institutions\u2019 descriptors of EuroVoc when the given institution or body is the author of the document and the document does not speak about its functioning, activity, etc.\n52011SC0622): Commission staff working paper accompanying the report from the Commission to the European parliament and the Council\nEUROVOC descriptor: Community financing / EC Commission / information. Author: European Commission. Descriptor EC Commission refers to the author of the document. This descriptor should be deleted.\nType of act: EuroVoc descriptors belonging to the top term \u2018document\u2019 or to \u2018EU act\u2019 should not be used for identifying the type of document. Other field of metadata is available for that purpose.\n52010XX1016(01): Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on Promoting Trust in the Information Society by Fostering Data Protection and Privacy\nEUROVOC descriptor: data processing / personal data / Community opinion / European data protection supervisor. Document type (FM): Opinion. Descriptor Community opinion refers to the type of the document. This descriptor should be deleted.\nType of procedure/parties (case-law): Descriptors referring to the nature of the proceeding, to the parties of proceeding (applicant, defendant) etc. should not be used. This information is covered by other metadata (PR). \n62008TA0449: Case T-449/08: Judgment of the General Court of 18 October 2011 \u2014 SLV Elektronik v OHIM \u2014 Jim\u00e9nez Mu\u00f1oz (LINE)\nEUROVOC descriptor: European trademark / trademark law / action for annulment of an EC decision / lighting equipment. Type of procedure: Action for annulment \u2013 successful. Descriptor action for annulment of an EC decision refers to the type of the procedure. This descriptor should be deleted.\n8. Achieve indexing consistency: Concerning the EUR-Lex documentary collection, the creation of flexible templates can be good solutions for achieving indexing consistency.
