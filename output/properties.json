Therefore, the in force indicator says \"In force\".\nWe assume the EV date should be equal to the date of accession (minus 1 day); but this assumption has not been confirmed by any relevant authority.\nBased on this, it was decided to remove EV field from such notices.\nSee https:\/\/webgate.ec.europa.eu\/publications\/jira\/browse\/LAAION-540 \nExamples: 22005A0617(02), 22005A0617(01), 22003A0515(01), 21993A1231(18), 21993A1231(15)\n29\/09\/2016: GIL-GM Amended proposal \u2013 end of validity date of the initial proposal\nCommission proposal can be amended a couple of times and that such amended proposals are published as separate notices on EUR-Lex. The questions is whether the end of validity date of the initial proposal can be understood as being the date of the adoption of the 1st amended proposal (minus 1 day) and whether the end of validity date of the 1st amended proposal can be understood as being the date of the adoption of the second amended proposal (minus 1 day)? Or should the first and second amended proposals be understood only as texts amending the initial proposal but not replacing it? The amended proposals can contain only the amendments or the amendments plus the original proposal, depending on the case-by-case basis. \nThe participants agreed that both the initial proposal and the amended proposal(s) should keep having the fictional date of end of validity (implying that they are \"pending\"), until a final act is adopted. After this, the date of adoption of the final act becomes the date of end of validity of both the initial proposal and amended proposals. \n\n12\/03\/2019: GIL-GM Follow-up of Court's decisions on annulment (P\/12032019\/4a)\nThe legal analysis methodology does not follow up on the annulments of legal acts by judgments of the Court of Justice. Currently the date of end of validity of those acts remains indefinite; therefore, they remain marked as 'in force'.\nThe Commission Legal Service was consulted and considered that the effect should be as if it had never existed, therefore the value contained in the date of effect field should be reproduced in the date of end of validity, and the in force indicator switched to 'not in force'. The participants agreed on this solution and indicated that the comment 'declared void by' should be shown below the title, next to the in force indicator coloured point.\nThis solution should also be applied to cases where the judgment annuls the decision but orders to maintain the effects of the decision in force.\n\nExample https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/ALL\/?qid=1571896291605&uri=CELEX:62011CJ0658: \n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby\n   \n1. Annuls Council Decision 2011\/640\/CFSP of 12 July 2011 on the signing and conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Mauritius on the conditions of transfer of suspected pirates and associated seized property from the European Union-led naval force to the Republic of Mauritius and on the conditions of suspected pirates after transfer;   \n\n2. Orders that the effects of Decision 2011\/640 be maintained in force\n\n12\/03\/2019: GIL-GM End of validity of international agreements when the decision on the signing was declared void by CdJ (P\/12032019\/4b)\nThe OP raised the question on how to proceed when the Court annuls the decision on the signing of an agreement. The participants agreed that in both decision and agreement cases the value corresponding to the date of entry into force should be set in the date of end of validity field.\nSee for example https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/ALL\/?qid=1571896291605&uri=CELEX:22011A0930(01)","104":null,"105":null,"106":null,"107":"08\/11\/2019: What is difference between similar question (HH) and related question (VV)?","108":null,"109":null,"110":"This relation should be completed with an annotation referring to Member State(s) concerned (role2) - Member states - codes in FD_375 to be created","111":null,"112":"26\/6\/2017: Changes related to the links between merger control documents (point 5 above)\nChanges related to the Council decision concerning the conclusion (and\/or signing and\/or provisional application and\/or approval and\/or signature) of an international agreement (point 4 above) \u2013 already in production\n\n20\/03\/2019: Concerning  point (3) Links between international agreements and agreements (in the form of an Exchange of Letters) concerning the provisional application of the international agreements - Add also Role2 from fd_375: APRO (provisional application)?

(01.06)\n(OR. fr)\n10894\/11\nLIMITE\nJUR 272\nINST 279\n\nOPINION OF THE LEGAL SERVICE(*)\n\n* This document contains legal advice protected under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC)\nNo 1049\/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding\npublic access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and not released\nby the Council of the European Union to the public. The Council reserves all its rights in law\nas regards any unauthorised publication.\n\nSubject: Date of adoption of acts under the ordinary legislative procedure\n- application of Article 13 of the Regulation on Committee Procedure (1)\n\n1. The purpose of this opinion of the Legal Service is to clarify the determination of the date on\nwhich acts are adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\n2. This question has arisen in particular for acts which were adopted before the Committee\nProcedure Regulation entered into force on 1 March 2011 and were signed by the Presidents\nof the European Parliament and of the Council after that date. Insofar as those acts refer to the\nold Decision on Committee Procedure (2), which was repealed on 1 March 2011 by the\nRegulation on Committee Procedure, the question arises of the applicability of Article 13 of\nthe Regulation on Committee Procedure.\n\n3. Under Article 294(4) TFEU, when the Council approves the position of the European\nParliament at first reading \"the act concerned shall be adopted in the wording which\ncorresponds to the position of the European Parliament\". The date of adoption of the act is\ntherefore that on which the Council approved the European Parliament's position.\n\n4. At second reading, the act is deemed to be adopted when:\n- within three months following the transmission of the first-reading position of the Council\nto the European Parliament, the latter approves the Council\u2019s position or has not taken a\ndecision (3); in that case, the date of adoption of the act should be considered to be that on\nwhich the European Parliament approved the Council's position or the date when the\nthree-month period expired; or\n- within three months following receipt of the European Parliament's amendments, the\nCouncil approves all the European Parliament's amendments by a qualified majority (4 ); in\nthat case, the date of adoption of the act should be considered to be that on which the\nCouncil approved the European Parliament's amendments.\n\n5. At third reading, the act is adopted when, within a period of \u2013 in principle \u2013 six weeks\nfollowing the approval of a joint text by the Conciliation Committee, the European Parliament\nand the Council adopt the act in question in accordance with that text(5). In that case, the date of\nadoption of the act should be deemed to be the date when the act was adopted by the second\nof the two institutions.\n\n6. The signing of the act by the presidents of the two institutions, provided for in Article 297(1),\nis distinct from the adoption of the act and its value consists solely in authentication of the\nact (6). Therefore, even if the date of signing is included in the title of the act, as published in the\nOfficial Journal, as the date of the act, it is not the same as the date of the act's adoption.\n\n7. Furthermore, the Legal Service deems incorrect the practice of including the date of signing\nof an act in its title, in that it can lead to confusion as to the date of the act's birth in the legal\nsystem of the EU, despite the systematic inclusion in acts adopted by the ordinary legislative\nprocedure of a footnote specifying the dates on which the European Parliament and the\nCouncil adopted their positions.\n\n8. In conclusion, the Legal Service considers that it follows from Article 294 TFEU that the date\non which an act is adopted by the ordinary legislative procedure is the date of the decision of\nthe arm of the legislature that acts later (see paragraphs 3 to 5 above) and not the date of the\njoint signing of the act by the presidents of the European Parliament and of the Council.\nArticle 13 of the Regulation on Committee Procedure therefore applies to acts adopted before\n1 March 2011 but signed after that date.\n\n(1) Regulation (EU) No 182\/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for\ncontrol by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55,\n28.2.2011, p. 13).\n(2) Council Decision 1999\/468\/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise\nof implementing powers conferred on the Commission (OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23).\n(3) Article 294(7)(a) TFEU.\n(4) Article 294(8)(a) TFEU.\n(5) Article 294 (13) TFEU.\n(6) However, as the Court of Justice has already held, failure to sign an act is an infringement of\nan essential procedural requirement of the act, which may, even automatically, entail the\nannulment of the act concerned by the EU's courts (Judgment of 6 April 2000 in cases\n(C-287\/95 and C-288\/95, ECR 2000 p.

Use EuroVoc for indexation and the Directory code and Subject headings for classification\n\nWhile indexing with EuroVoc, indexer should keep in mind the different purpose and the use of an indexing tool and a classification tool.\nThe systematic use of general EuroVoc terms (most frequently top terms) can easily result in classifying the documents instead of indexing them, so their use should be limited to documents at very general level and only to documents that really speak about the selected general descriptor. \nThis principle is in line with the principle that the most specific EuroVoc term should be used. Before assigning a general term (top term) to a document, indexer is asked to examine whether one of its specific term corresponds better to the content of the document.\nClassifying instead of indexing may occur not only at top terms level but at specific level as well. To avoid this, indexer is always asked to verify before assigning a descriptor to a document whether the chosen descriptor really corresponds to the content of the document (indexation) or only classifies the document by referring to its main subject(s) (classification).\n\ni) 32011D0302: Council implementing decision 2011\/302\/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Syria\nThis document concerns in general the common foreign and security policy.

Follow the three stages of indexing \n\nIf the three intellectual stages of the indexation process are not respected, it may lead to some typical indexation errors and may negatively affect the performance of the query. \nThese errors are the followings:\n\nA. Missing descriptors \nIf descriptors are missing, the query system will not retrieve the relevant documents answering to the users' query. There will be an information loss or 'silence' and desscriptor has to be added. \n\nMissing descriptors occurs due to imperfection:\n\u2022 either in identification of the essential concepts with a potential value for the users during document analysis\n\u2022 or in translation of these identified concepts into EuroVoc descriptors\n\nIf there is no descriptor in EuroVoc corresponding to the selected concept (neither at the same level of specificity, nor at the next higher level), indexer should try to represent the given concept by the combination of several existing descriptors.\nIf it is not possible, propositions can be sent to the OP by using the 'Contribute' menu of the EuroVoc website in order to include a new descriptor in EuroVoc.\n\ni) 2011CN0414: Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Polimeles Protodikio Athinon (Greece) lodged on 8 August 2011\nThis document concerns questions, which should be clarified by the Court of Justice: \"Under Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement are chemical and pharmaceutical products patentable subject matter provided that they satisfy the requirements for the grant of patents and, if so, what is the scope of their protection?\"\n\nDescriptor TRIPS \u2013 the main descriptors which should be used to cover the subject of the document \u2013 was missing:\n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \nEuropean patent \/ patent law \/ chemical product \/ pharmaceutical product \n\nii) 32011R1004: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1004\/2011 of 11 October 2011 amending the representative prices and additional import duties for certain products in the sugar sector fixed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 971\/2011 for the 2011\/12 marketing year\nOne of the main descriptors (\"representative price\") was missing:\n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \nCommunity import \/ raw sugar \/ CCT duties \/ beet sugar \/ cane sugar \n\niii) 32011D0634: Council Decision of 17 May 2011 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the International Cocoa Agreement 2010\n\u2022 One of the main descriptors (\"signature of an agreement\") was missing.\n\u2022 If a document concerns an agreement, also the type and the field (EC trade agreement) of the agreement should be expressed by indexing terms \u2013 see also Annex III (Descriptors clarification), EC agreement.\n \nEUROVOC descriptor: \nsustainable development(*) \/ economic growth(*)  \/ cocoa \n (*) In this case too general descriptors were used.

Incorrect descriptors \nIf descriptors are incorrectly used (not relevant, out of context), the query system will retrieve several but irrelevant documents, there will be a 'noise' \uf0e0 In that case, incorrect descriptors have to be deleted. \n\nThe use of incorrect descriptors is due to: \n\u2022 either the misunderstanding of the content of the document\n\u2022 or to the defect in examining the contextual and semantic environment of the selected descriptor (non-preferred terms, related terms, hierarchy, notes) which may lead to the misunderstanding of the selected descriptor\n\nTheoretically, the semantic environment of a descriptor helps to clarify the meaning of a descriptor, but if it is not the case, clarification and additional notes to a EuroVoc term can be demanded from the OP. \n\ni) 620091TA00118: Case T-118\/09: Judgment of the General Court of 5 October 2011 \u2014 La Sonrisa de Carmen and Bloom Clothes v OHIM \u2014 Heldmann (BLOOMCLOTHES)\n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \nreal estate business \/ European trademark \/ registered trademark \n\nThis document concerns the trademark law.

Indexer is asked to use the most specific descriptor corresponding to the products and not only descriptors referring to the category of the concerned products. More specific descriptors (citrus fruit, grape, pip fruit and fruit vegetable) should be used in this case. \n\nIf EuroVoc has no descriptor at the same level of specificity as the selected concept, the descriptor at the next higher level should be chosen: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 388\/2011 of 19 April 2011 concerning the authorisation of maduramicin ammonium alpha as a feed additive for chickens for fattening (holder of authorisation Alpharma (Belgium) BVBA) and amending Regulation (EC) No 2430\/1999 Text with EEA relevance: Since EuroVoc has no descriptor for \u2018maduramicin ammonium\u2019 (which is an antibiotic), use the descriptor at the next higher level.\n \nIn some cases, specific terms are considered in EuroVoc as non-preferred terms of generic terms. (e.g. name of classes and their components \u2013 reptile NPT crocodile)\n\n4. Simultaneous use of several descriptors belonging to the same hierarchical line\n\nBefore indexers select a Eurovoc term, they should navigate the content of the thesaurus and analyze the hierarchical relationships of the selected terms. It will alert them to the existence of a more or a less generic term belonging to the same hierarchical line: if both of them suits to the content of the document, the most specific one should be used.\n\ni) 32011R0418: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 418\/2011 of 28 April 2011 amending the representative prices and additional import duties for certain products in the sugar sector fixed by Regulation (EU) No 867\/2010 for the 2010\/11 marketing year\n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \nsugar product \/ syrup \/ representative price \/ CCT duties\nDescriptors sugar product and syrup belong to the same hierarchical line.

The most specific should be chosen.\n\n5. Prefer pre-coordinated descriptors to \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors or to the combination of two or more \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors\n\nEuroVoc, originally built up specifically for processing the documentary collection of the EU institutions, contains a large number of pre-coordinated descriptors in the field of EU activities. These pre-coordinated descriptors (e.g. \u2018import (EU)\u2019) exist in parallel with \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors (e.g. \u2018import\u2019), either with a hierarchical relationship between them (same hierarchical line) or as related terms, belonging to different top terms or microthesauri.\nGiving preference to the use of pre-coordinated EuroVoc descriptors is essential since it affects the performance of the query results.\nIn EUR-Lex, there are an important number of documents that requires pre-coordinated descriptors. If EuroVoc does not contain the necessary pre-coordinated descriptor, propositions can be sent to the OP via the Contribute menu of Euro.\n\nExamples of pre-coordinated descriptors:\nappointment of staff (in general, BT personnel administration). Do not use this descriptors for indexing a document about the appointments in EU institutions\/bodies Ex: 32011D0243\nappointment of members \u2013 pre-coordinated \u2013 use only for the appointments in EU institutions, bodies, agencies\n\nbudget financing \u2013 resources of a budget (national budget, budget of an organisation, etc.)\nfinancing of the EU budget \u2013 pre-coordinated  \u2013 concerns the different types of resources of the EU (Where does the money come from?

If possible, use specific pre-coordinated descriptors for the different types of EU agreements (European association agreement, association agreement (EU), cooperation agreement (EU), interim agreement (EU), trade agreement (EU), negotiation of an agreement (EU)) EX: 32011D0334\n\naction programme \u2013 BT management (UF framework programme, plan of action, work programme) Do not use for EU programmes Ex: 52011AE0533\nEU programme \u2013 pre-coordinated\n\n6. Use geographical descriptors\n\nDomain 72 Geograpy of EuroVoc contains geographical descriptors. Use descriptors of countries when a document concerns specifically one or more countries or examines a particular situation in a given country. For example:\n\u2022 agreement with a country\n\u2022 action against a State \/ judgment of a court concerning a country\n\u2022 national statistics\n\u2022 state aid regime of a country \/ authorization of State aid, etc.\n\u2022 EU financing expenditure in a State\n\u2022 origin of a product\n\u2022 national law of a State\n \nGroup of countries \/ international organisations\nIf the document speaks about group of countries or international organisations as a whole, do not list the name of the member countries, but use only the descriptor concerning the group from the domain 76 International organisations. \nHowever, if needed, country names and descriptors referring to an organisation\/group of country can be used simultaneously since they do not belong to the same hierarchical line and domain. \n\n52010XG0415(01): Notice for the attention of the persons, entities and bodies to which restrictive measures provided for in Council Decision 2011\/239\/CFSP apply\n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \ninternational sanctions \/ economic sanctions \/ natural person  \nA geographical descriptor is missing (Myanmar). Restrictive measures are provided against Burma\/Myanmar. \n\nRegions\nOnly the names of regions of EU Member States are in EuroVoc, but not those of third countries. \nUse regions' names when a document is specifically about a region of an EU Member State. \nIf needed, regions names can be used together with country names since they do not belong to the same hierarchical line. \n\n52010X0416(03): Summary information communicated by Member States on State aid granted \n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \nItaly \/ fishing industry \/ aid system \/ control of State aid \/ small and medium-sized enterprises \/ aquaculture \/ State aid \nA geographical descriptor is missing (Sardegne). State aid was granted by the 'Regione Autonoma della Sardegna'.\n\n7. Physical entity of the document\n\nIndexation of the EUR-Lex documentary collection with EuroVoc should not concern the type and\/or the author of the document. This information are covered by other metadata, EuroVoc descriptors should be only used to index the content of the document.\n\nAuthor\nThe use of \u2018institutions\u2019 descriptors (EU institutions, bodies, services, organisations, agencies and international organizations) should be limited to documents which are about:\n\u2022 the functioning of an institution (rules of procedures, composition, appointment, etc.)\n\u2022 the competencies of an institution\n\u2022 the role of an institution\n\u2022 the activity of an institution\n\u2022 agreements, cooperation between institutions\n\nDo not use \u2018institutions\u2019 descriptors of EuroVoc when the given institution or body is the author of the document and the document does not speak about its functioning, activity, etc.\n\n52011SC0622): Commission staff working paper accompanying the report from the Commission to the European parliament and the Council\n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \nCommunity financing \/ EC Commission \/ information  \n\nAuthor: \nEuropean Commission \n\nDescriptor EC Commission refers to the author of the document. This descriptor should be deleted.\n\nType of document\/of act\nEuroVoc descriptors belonging to the top term \u2018document\u2019 or to \u2018EU act\u2019 should not be used for identifying the type of document. Other field of metadata is available for that purpose.\n\n52010XX1016(01): Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on Promoting Trust in the Information Society by Fostering Data Protection and Privacy\n\nEUROVOC descriptor: \ndata processing \/ personal data \/ Community opinion \/ European data protection supervisor \n\nForm: \nOpinion \n\nDescriptor Community opinion refers to the type of the document. This descriptor should be deleted.\n\nType of procedure\/parties (case-law)\nDescriptors referring to the nature of the proceeding, to the parties of proceeding (applicant, defendant) etc. should not be used.

When the document deals with one special issue, indexing must then be done using the most specific descriptor fitting as properly as possible the topic covered by the document. If no existing heading specifically suits the document, it has to be filed under the closest more general entry.\n\nAs a consequence, the same document should never be indexed simultaneously using, within the same directory, a general heading and a more specific heading positioned hierarchically underneath it.\n\nFor example, the same document should bear one proper descriptor and not be labelled as such:\n07.20.30.00 Transport policy \/ Inland transport \/ Market operation\n07.20.30.30 Transport policy \/ Inland transport \/ Market operation \/ Transport prices and terms \n\nWhen a document deals with multiple topics related to several sub-headings of the same chapter, instead of indexing under one general entry, multiple headings should be chosen provided they all are of the same level. However, it is better to minimize the number of descriptors used to prevent that acts are published in several places in the directory.\n\nFor example, a text regarding both excise duties and individual tax exemptions should be analysed as such:\n09.30.20. Taxation \/ Indirect taxation \/ Excise duties\n09.30.40. Taxation \/ Indirect taxation \/ Individual tax exemptions\n\nand not 09.30. Taxation \/ Indirect taxation\n\nThe classification of EUR-Lex documents with the Directory Codes will have to be performed in line with the ISO 5963 standard, completed with what the guidelines as stated in this document.\n\nBasic rules\n\nWhat is document classification?\n\nClassification consists of assigning documents to one or more categories based on their main topics. When classifying, it must be kept in mind that it is not the content of the document that is being described (indexation) but the main subject(s) that the document covers (classification).\n\nBasic principles of classification:\n\n\u2022 Follow the three stages of classification:\n\n     o Examination of the document (intellectual analysis).\n     o Identification of the main topic(s) covered by the document.\n     o Selection of the directory codes that correspond with the main topics previously identified.\n\n\u2022 Be as specific as possible. Choose the directory code(s) which adjust better to the main topic(s).\n\n\u2022 Do not classify a document with two directory codes (general and specific) belonging to the same hierarchical line. It is possible to use various codes under the same domain but it is not possible to use the main domain and one of its subdivisions. For example:\n\nCorrect: 03.20.30.00 Agriculture \/ Agricultural structural funds \/ European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development\nIncorrect: 03.00.00.00 Agriculture \n\n\u2022 Keep the end-user in mind. The directory codes are employed by the user for document retrieval therefore it is important to select the directory codes which have a potential value for the users. If a document is not correctly classified the user will get irrelevant results in its query.\n\n\u2022 Be careful with the \"General\" or \"Miscellaneous\" categories. These must be used only if no other subdivision is adequate for the classification of the document. An overuse of these categories leads to \"noise\" after a query (retrieval of numerous documents which are not relevant to the user).\n\nClassification guidelines \u2013 How to assign directory codes:\n\nThe first directory code to be assigned will conform to the following instructions:\n\nEU legislation must be based on an appropriate treaty provision which means that each institution must act within powers conferred by a treaty. \nThe legal basis of EU legal acts are mentioned in the documents. The make reference to the provision which confers competence to adopt the act in question. \nTreaty provisions are grouped under Treaty titles, chapters, sections or in protocols. Since the Directory codes cover the EU activities and competences, a correspondence can be set up between the Treaty titles, chapters, etc and the subdivision of the Directory. \nIt means that the legal basis can be used as solid information to classify the legal acts and for this a correspondence table between the articles of TEU and TFEU and the Directory Codes has been created.\n\nIf in the correspondence table there is a reference to one of the main domains in the Directory Codes (e.g. 01 General, financial and institutional matters) it means that, if possible, the classifier will have to choose the most specific subdivision within the main domain.\nIf in the correspondence table there is a reference to more than one directory code the classifier must choose the most specific subdivision form each chapter or from the most adequate chapter of the Directory. \n\nThe subsequent directory codes (if any) will be assigned following the basic classification principles previously mentioned.\nThe legal basis of non-legislative acts makes reference to a basic act. In this case, the Treaty provision of this act has to be used for classification.\nPreparatory documents don't have a legal basis, but usually there is mention to the legal basis of the proposed act which can be used for classification. \n\nThe minimum number of directory codes that can be assigned to a document is one (1). There is no maximum number of directory codes that can be assigned to a document, but it is recommended not to use more than three (3).\n","27":null,"28":"Used especially in sector 9 in the past","29":null,"30":"Several comments and identification codes for management purposes. \n\nCurrently the following codes are used:\n\nMAN0  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 0 (before 1995)\nMAN1  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 1 (since 1995)\nMAN2  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 2 (daily production)\nMAN3  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 3 (since 1995 \u2013 amendments to repealed acts)\nMAN4  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 4 (since 1998 \u2013 correction pagination)\nINFO1  -  Non-legal documentation \nEPH    - ephemeral documents (acts relating to day-to-day management of agricultural matters;titles of such acts are are printed in light type on the cover of OJ-L)\n\nNo other entries are allowed without prior authorisation.\nThis field has a free text format and the contents are exported without translation to the EUR-Lex dissemination databases.\nInternal comment is currently not displayed on the EUR-Lex.\n, Several comments and identification codes for management purposes. \n\nCurrently the following codes are used:\n\nMAN0  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 0 (before 1995)\nMAN1  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 1 (since 1995)\nMAN2  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 2 (daily production)\nMAN3  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 3 (since 1995 \u2013 amendments to repealed acts)\nMAN4  -  mise \u00e0 niveau 4 (since 1998 \u2013 correction pagination)\nINFO1  -  Non-legal documentation \nEPH    - ephemeral documents (acts relating to day-to-day management of agricultural matters;titles of such acts are are printed in light type on the cover of OJ-L)\n\nNo other entries are allowed without prior authorisation.\nThis field has a free text format and the contents are exported without translation to the EUR-Lex dissemination databases.\nInternal comment is currently not displayed on the EUR-Lex.\n","31":null,"32":"Defendant as indicated in the title of sector 6 documents or in the text:\n\nAction brought on 16 August 2019 \u2013 Micreos Food Safety v Commission (Case T-568\/19)\n(2019\/C 372\/33)\nLanguage of the case: English\nParties\nApplicant: Micreos Food Safety BV (Wageningen, Netherlands) (represented by: S.

Index the content of the document: use thesaurus terms for document content indexation and not for classification \n\nThe thesaurus is an indexing tool. Indexing consists of representing the content of the document with selected descriptors of a thesaurus in the purpose of document retrieval. \n\nIndexation does not consist of classifying documents according to their main subject(s) with a classification scheme or a subject heading list.\n\nIndexation with thesaurus terms is often contrasted to classification with a classification scheme. Classification consists of assigning documents to one ore more categories based on their main topics. \n\n2. Follow the three stages of indexing \n\nIndexation is a complex, intellectual decision process including the following steps:\n\n\u2022 1.2.1 examining the document (intellectual analysis)\n\nIn order to be able to analyse the content of documents, indexer should have adequate knowledge of the field covered by the document. Indexer should understand the concepts and main ideas encountered in the document.\n\n\u2022 1.2.2 identifying the principal concepts and the essential elements of the document \n\nIn order to be able to select the concepts which have a potential value for the users, indexer should know the purpose for which the indexing terms will be used (document retrieval).\n\n\u2022 1.2.3 expressing the selected concepts in thesaurus terms\n\nIn order to be able to represent the selected concepts with thesaurus terms, indexer should have adequate knowledge of the vocabulary he\/she is using (structure, preferred terms and non-preferred terms, cross-relations, etc). \nSince the meaning of a descriptor is clarified by the thesaurus itself (by the relations of a term with other descriptors), indexer is asked to always examine the contextual and semantic environment of the descriptors:\n\n\u2022 Domain \n\u2022 Microtheasurus\n\u2022 USE\/UF \u2013 preferred terms and non-preferred terms\n\u2022 Top term and narrow terms\n\u2022 Related terms\n\u2022 Notes\n\n3. Be as specific as possible \n\nWhen indexing, the most specific term available in the thesaurus should be selected to represent the given concept. It means that:\n\n\u2022 the descriptor chosen to represent the selected concept of the document should be at the same level of specificity as the selected concept\n\n\u2022 if the thesaurus has no descriptor at the same level of specificity as the selected concept, the descriptor at the next higher level should be chosen (descriptor which is closest to the concept)\n\nLoss of specificity occurs when a particular concept of a document is represented by an indexing term with more general meaning while an indexing term at the same level of specificity is available in the thesaurus.\n\nExceptions\n\nIn some special cases, indexing at a more general level than the selected concept may be justified. For example:\n\n\u2022 when very specific concepts occur only casually or in the fringe area of the document, but the main part of the document is at general level \n\u2022 when a (long) document covers a lot of specific area (all the specific EU policies or all countries, etc.) which can be summarized in one or more generic terms\n\n4. Do not index simultaneously with several descriptors (specific and general) belonging to the same hierarchical line \n\nThe reasons for not indexing simultaneously with two or more descriptors belonging to the same hierarchy are the followings:\n\n\u2022 it avoids multiple, redundant indexing\n\u2022 broader indexing terms are linked to the more specific ones by the hierarchical tree structure of the thesaurus \u2013 ascending and\/or descending (auto)posting is possible\n (In EUR-Lex, if the user searches for a generic term, all the documents indexed with one  of its narrower terms will be found)\n\nN.B.: Descriptors on the same hierarchical level and related terms can be used simultaneously. \n\n5. Prefer pre-coordinated descriptors to \u2018simple\u2019 descriptors or to the combination of two or more simple descriptors\n\nPre-coordinated descriptors have been created in order to be able to represent with only one descriptor a complex, compound concept, instead of being obliged to combine several simple descriptors. The use of pre-coordinated descriptors gives better results in document retrieval than the combination of descriptors.\n\nIf there is no pre-coordinated descriptor in a thesaurus which can represent the selected compound concept, indexer should try to express it through the combination of two or more simple descriptors. \n\n6. Use geographical descriptors \n\nIf the geographical context of a document is clearly mentioned or a document deals specifically with a country, region or an international organization, use thesaurus geographical descriptors.  \n\n7. Indexing should not concern the physical entity of the document \n\nType of document, author or any other metadata which do not concern the content of the document should not be indexed with thesaurus terms. This information is covered by other metadata. \n\n8. Achieve indexing consistency \n\nWithin a large indexing team, a centralized checking stage is recommended to be set up and the creation of flexible templates can be good solutions for achieving indexing consistency.\n","116":null},"notations":{"0":"SUSPEND_PAR","1":"COMMUNIC_REQ","2":"EXAMPLE_FR","3":"ANN_LVL","4":"DL","5":"LABEL","6":"AF","7":"IMPLEMENTATION","8":"TT","9":"DD","10":"AMENDMENT_PRO","11":"RP","12":"IF","13":"CLASSIFICATION","14":"OPINION_EP","15":"RI","16":null,"17":"REPEAL","18":"CT","19":"ADOPTION","20":"AP","21":"DN","22":"RJ_NEW","23":"APPLICABILITY_DEF","24":"ANN_MSL","25":"DN_CLASS","26":"CC","27":"ANN_FCS","28":"REFER_PAR","29":"EXAMPLE_EN","30":"CM, CM","31":"ANNULMENT_REQ","32":"DF","33":"INCORPORATION","34":"DTN","35":"LF","36":"PRELIMINARY_REQ","37":"ANN_COD","38":"ANN_FCT","39":"FAILURE_REQ","40":"KEYWORD","41":"ANN_PAR","42":"DP, DP","43":"ECLI","44":"PROC","45":"REPPORTEUR, REPPORTEUR","46":"OPINION_EESC","47":"ANN_EOV","48":"REP, REP","49":"NS","50":"LO","51":"ANN_TLT","52":"RS, RS","53":"MI","54":"REPLACEMENT","55":"LG, LG","56":"VALIDITY_EXT","57":"OPINION_COR","58":"ANN_RL2","59":"OPINION_REQ","60":"AS, AS","61":"APPLICABILITY_EXT","62":"CORRIGENDUM","63":"DTT","64":"DH","65":"ELI","66":"ANN_SOV","67":"TP, TP","68":"SG","69":"ASSOCIATION","70":"COMMENT","71":"AMENDMENT","72":"ADOPTION_PAR","73":"FM","74":"COMPLETION","75":"CONFIRMATION","76":"ANN_SUB","77":"SUSPEND","78":"OBSOLETE","79":"REPEAL_IMP","80":"IC","81":"NF","82":"LB","83":"AU","84":"DTA","85":"OJ_ID","86":"QUESTION_RELATED","87":"ANN_TOD","88":"REESTAB","89":"PR","90":"AD, AD","91":"VV, VV","92":"INAPPLICAB_REQ","93":"DB, DB","94":"EXAMPLE_CELEX","95":"INFLUENCE","96":"ANULMENT_PARTIAL_REQ","97":"DESCRIPTION","98":"VO","99":"REVIEW_REQ","100":"DT_CORR","101":"PARENT","102":"ANN_CLB","103":"EV","104":"ORDER","105":"ANN_ART","106":"CDM_CLASS","107":"QUESTION_SIMILAR","108":"ADDITION","109":"CI","110":"DEROGATION","111":"DTS","112":"RELATION","113":"CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE, CODE","114":"INTERPRETATION","115":"DC","116":"ANN_MDL"},"labels":{"0":"Link: Partially suspends document","1":"Link: Communication on CdJ","2":"FR example","3":"Annotation: Language list","4":"Date of deadline","5":"Label of the concept","6":"Political group","7":"Link: Implementation","8":"Treaty","9":"Document date","10":"Link: Amendment proposal","11":"Date of reply","12":"Date of effect","13":"Classification","14":"Link: EP opinion","15":"Internal reference","16":"Nationality of parties","17":"Link: Repeal","18":"Subject matter","19":"Link: Adoption","20":"Applicant ","21":"complete CELEX number value","22":"Case law directory code","23":"Link: Deferrs applicability","24":"Annotation: Reference to modifying location","25":"reference to CELEX class","26":"Directory code","27":"Annotation: Fragment citing source","28":"Link: Partial referral","29":"EN example","30":"Internal comments, Internal comments","31":"Link: Annulment request","32":"Defendant ","33":"Link: Incorporation","34":"CELEX number -
